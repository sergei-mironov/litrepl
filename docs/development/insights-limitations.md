## Insights and limitations

The following events should normally happen after users type the `:LEval`
command:

1. On the first run, LitREPL starts the Python interpreter in the background.
   Its standard input and output are redirected into UNIX pipes in the current
   directory.
2. LitREPL runs the whole document through the express Markdown/Latex parser
   determining the start/stop positions of code and result sections. The cursor
   position is also available and the code from the right code section can
   reach the interpreter.
3. The process which reads the interpreter's response is forked out of the main
   LitREPL process. The output goes to the temporary file.
4. If the interpreter reports the completion quickly, the output is pasted to
   the resulting document immediately. Otherwise, the temporary results are
   pasted.
5. Re-evaluating sections with temporary results causes LitREPL to update
   these results.

Known Limitations:

* Formatting: Nested code sections are not supported.
* ~~Formatting: Special symbols in the Python output could invalidate the
  document~~.
* Interpreter: Extra newline is required after Python function definitions.
* Interpreter: Stdout and stderr are joined together.
* ~~Interpreter: Evaluation of a code section locks the editor~~.
* Interpreter: Tweaking `os.ps1`/`os.ps2` prompts of the Python interpreter
  could break the session.
* ~~Interpreter: No asynchronous code execution.~~
* ~~Interpreter: Background Python interpreter couldn't be interrupted~~
