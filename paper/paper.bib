  year = {1962},

  abstract = {From the PrefaceApplied mathematics is largely concerned with the design and analysis
              of explicit procedures for calculating the exact or approximate values of various
              functions. Such explicit procedures are called algorithms or programs. Because an
              effective notation for the description of programs exhibits considerable syntactic
              structure, it is called a programming language.Much of applied mathematics,
              particularly the more recent computer-related areas which cut across the older
              disciplines, suffers from the lack of an adequate programming language. It is the
              central thesis of this book that the descriptive and analytic power of an adequate
              programming language amply repays the considerable effort required for its mastery.
              This thesis is developed by first presenting the entire language and then applying it
              in later chapters to several major topics.The areas of application are chosen
              primarily for their intrinsic interest and lack of previous treatment, but they are
              also designed to illustrate the universality and other facets of the language. For
              example, the microprogramming of Chapter 2 illustrates the divisibility of the
              language, i.e., the ability to treat a restricted area using only a small portion of
              the complete language. Chapter 6 (Sorting) shows its capacity to compass a relatively
              complex and detailed topic in a short space. Chapter 7 (The Logical Calculus)
              emphasizes the formal manipulability of the language and its utility in theoretical
              work.The material was developed largely in a graduate course given for several years
              at Harvard and in a later course presented repeatedly at the IBM Systems Research
              Institute in New York. It should prove suitable for a two-semester course at the
              senior or graduate level. Although for certain audiences an initial presentation of
              the entire language may be appropriate, I have found it helpful to motivate the
              development by presenting the minimum notation required for a given topic, proceeding
              to its treatment (e.g., microprogramming), and then returning to further notation. The
              130-odd problems not only provide the necessary finger exercises but also develop
              results of general interest.Chapter 1 or some part of it is prerequisite to each of
              the remaining "applications" chapters, but the applications chapters are virtually
              independent of one another. A complete appreciation of search techniques (Chapter 4)
              does, however, require a knowledge of methods of representation (Chapter 3). The cross
              references which do occur in the applications chapters are either nonessential or are
              specific to a given figure, table, or program. The entire language presented in
              Chapter 1 is summarized for reference at the end of the book.},
