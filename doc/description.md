**Litrepl** is a command-line processor for *Markdown* or *LaTeX* documents with
**literate programming** code sections. Instructed by its arguments, it
evaluates and updates sections via background interpreters. Interpreters can
stay active for a **read-eval-paste-loop** style. The repository includes a Vim
plugin to demonstrate editor integration.
